A retro-styled **JavaScript browser game** inspired by *Thrust*, with a cooperative twist.  
Two players must clamp onto a physics-driven bomb with short ropes and carefully fly it together through winding caverns to the extraction zone.  

Built with **HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript** — no external libraries required.

## 🎮 Gameplay

### Objective
Work together to **retrieve the bomb** from deep within the caves and carry it safely to the green extraction zone at the surface.  

### Controls
**Player 1 (P1 🚀)**  
- `A` / `D` → Rotate  
- `W` → Thrust  
- `S` → Clamp / Release  

**Player 2 (P2 🚀)**  
- `←` / `→` → Rotate  
- `↑` → Thrust  
- `↓` → Clamp / Release  

### Mechanics
- **Harmony Meter**: Both ships must clamp onto the bomb to lift it.  
  - Fly smoothly and align angles with your partner.  
  - Poor harmony destabilizes the bomb.  
- **Bomb Stability**: Impacts or disharmony reduce stability. If it reaches **0% → BOOM 💥**.  
- **Hazards**:  
  - Cave walls damage ships.  
  - Hard crashes shake the camera and risk destruction.  
- **Landing Pads** (green): Repair damage and refuel ships.
